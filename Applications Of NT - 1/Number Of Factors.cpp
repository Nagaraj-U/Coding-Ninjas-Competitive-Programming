A number is called n-factorful if it has exactly n distinct prime factors. Given positive integers a, b, and n, your task is to find the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are n-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.
Input
Your input will consist of a single integer T followed by a newline and T test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing integers a, b, and n as described above.
Output
Output for each test case one line containing the number of n-factorful integers in [a, b].
Constraints
T < 10000

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ n ≤ 10
