Distinct Query Problem
Send Feedback
Given a sequence of n numbers a1, a2, ..., an and a number of d-queries. A d-query is a pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n). For each d-query (i, j), you have to return the number of distinct elements in the subsequence ai, ai+1, ..., aj.
Input
Line 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000).
Line 2: n numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6).
Line 3: q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200000), the number of d-queries.
In the next q lines, each line contains 2 numbers i, j representing a d-query (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n).
Output
For each d-query (i, j), print the number of distinct elements in the subsequence ai, ai+1, ..., aj in a single line.
