/*
You are given k identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.
You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or 
below floor f will not break.
Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However,
if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
 
Example 1:
Input: k = 1, n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
Example 2:
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3
Example 3:
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4
 
Constraints:
1 <= k <= 100
1 <= n <= 104

/*
optmize the bad luck
calculate max moves from each of the floors and finally take min from all floors
example lets say you are at stage where 
eggs = 2 , floors = 3  (2,3)
you can drop egg from 1 or 2 or 3rd floor
and whenever you drop from kth floor there are 2 possibilities either egg break o survives
consider 1st floor 
when breaks you have 1 egg , and check for above floors since we know that below floors cannot be answer
therefore 
from 1st floor , 
breaks    ----> (1,0) , check for below 0 floors (egg count reduced)
survives ----> (2,2)  , check for above 2 floors
from 2nd floor
breaks ----> (1,1) below 1 floors
survive ---> (2,1) above 1 floors
from 3rd floor
breaks ---> (1,2) below 2 floors
survives --->(2,0) no above floors left
//choosing max at each floor , because we need answer in worst case(guerenteed answer) , regardless of where 
the floor lies
take min (max(1st break,1st survive) , max(2nd break , 2nd survive) , max(3rd break,3rd survive))

//for each floor find the max(break,survive) and finally take the minimum of overall floors
