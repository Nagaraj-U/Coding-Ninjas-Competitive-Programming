Cubic Square

Varun is learning method of successive squaring so that he can calculate a^b mod m quickly. To give himself practice he wrote many tuples of a, b and m and went to school thinking that he will do it after school.
After school he found that tuples he wrote are modified by his little sister. His sister converted each b into base 3. Varun wrote everything in base 10.
Help Varun to do his excercise.
Input
First line of input contains a number T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follows each containing three numbers a (<=10^9), b and m (<=10^5) (a in base 10, b in base 3 and m in base 10). Number of digits in b will be less than 250.
Output
Output a number for each test case a^b mod m in base 10.
Sample Input:
2
2 10 10
3 21101 19
Sample Output:
8
3
